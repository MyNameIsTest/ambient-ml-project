# Ambient Music Generation

This repo contains four folders:

* `audio` - Contains the audio samples we're transcribing. Feel free to add more to `audio/samples`.
* `magenta` - Contains a Python implementation and a Javascript implementation.
* `nfjones-audio-to-midi-implementation` - A folder containing the source for `audio-to-midi`, though nothing is yet implemented.
