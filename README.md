# Ambient Music Generation

This repo contains four folders:

* [`audio`](https://github.com/thekevinscott/ambient-music-generation/tree/master/audio) - Contains the audio samples we're transcribing. Feel free to add more to `audio/samples`.
* `magenta` - Contains a [Python implementation]() and a [Javascript implementation](https://github.com/thekevinscott/ambient-music-generation/tree/master/magenta/javascript-implementation).
* [`nfjones-audio-to-midi-implementation`](https://github.com/thekevinscott/ambient-music-generation/tree/master/nfjones-audio-to-midi-implementation) - A folder containing the source for `audio-to-midi`, though nothing is yet implemented.
